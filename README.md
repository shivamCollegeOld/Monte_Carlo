# Monte Carlo Simulation

This repository contains all my submissions to assignments completed during  study of the course MA 323: Monte Carlo Simulation, taken in Autumn 2020 at IIT Guwahati.

All the details can be find in the respective folders. Following is a brief summary of the assignments:

## Lab - 1
This lab covered about **general linear congruence generator**, and Spectral Test for the random numbers.

## Lab - 2
This lab was based on using special kind of random number generators, and introduction to the Sampling Method with **Inverse Transform Method**.

## Lab - 3
This lab continued with the concepts of Sampling Method by using **Acceptance Rejection Method**, and using these methods to both discrete and continuous distributions.

## Lab - 4
This lab focused on a special kind of distribution, **Beta Distribution**, and how to use Acceptance Rejection Method on such distributions.

## Lab - 5
This lab was aimed at computational comparsion of 2 different methods to generate normal random numbers - **Box-Muller method**, and **Marsaglia and Bray Method**.

## Lab - 6
This lab focused on the binomial asset pricing model and using it to price a European Call and European Put Option under continuous compounding convention.

## Lab - 7
This lab extended on the binomial asset pricing model and using to to price a lookback option.

## Lab - 8
The aim of this lab was to find out the expected value of the stock prices using **Geometric Brownian Motion (gBm) model**.
