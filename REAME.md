# Monte Carlo Simulation

This repository contains all my submissions to assignments written during  study of the MA 323: Monte Carlo Simulation course taken in Autumn 2020 at IIT Guwahati.

All the details can be find in the respective folders. Following is a brief summary of the assignments:

## Lab - 1
This lab covered about **general linear congruence generator**, and Spectral Test for the random numbers.

## Lab - 2
This lab was based on using special kind of random number generators, and introduction to the Sampling Method with **Inverse Transform Method**.

## Lab - 3
This lab continued with the concepts of Sampling Method by using **Acceptance Rejection Method**, and using these methods to both discrete and continuous distributions.

## Lab - 4
This lab focused on a special kind of distribution, **Beta Distribution**, and how to use Acceptance Rejection Method on such distributions.

## Lab - 5
This lab was aimed at computational comparsion of 2 different methods to generate normal random numbers - **Box-Muller method**, and **Marsaglia and Bray Method**.

## Lab - 6
This lab continued with the generation of normal random numbers, but this time the distribution was **multivariate normal distribution**.

## Lab - 7
The aim of this lab was to find out the expected value of the stock prices using **Geometric Brownian Motion (gBm) model**.

## Lab - 8
It was the continuation of lab 7, but this time the model used was **Merton's Jump Diffusion model**.

## Lab - 9
This lab discussed about the idea of using **Control Variates** to determine the option prices based on BSM framework, to achieve variance reduction.

## Lab - 10
This lab was continuation of previous lab, but dealt with the concept of **Anithetic Variates** for variance reduction.

## Lab - 11
This lab was aimed at finding the **Discrepancy** of the random numbers generated using general LCG.

## Lab - 12
The last lab focused on generating low discrepancy sequences for one dimension (**Van der Corput sequences**), and d-dimension (**Halton Sequences**). Further their sample distribution was compared with that of LCG used in previous labs.
